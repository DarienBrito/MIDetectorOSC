MIDetectorOSC
=============

Supercollider extension Quark-wannabe for relaying Music Information via OSC.
The main motivation behind this quark is to have connect visual interactions with sound interactions via OSC Messaging.
Ideally you would run the detector in SC and relay the info to your favorite program like Processing, OF, Cinder, etc.

How to install and use
-------------------------

1) git clone to the Supercollider/quarks folder.

2) copy MIDetectorOSC.quark to the Supercollider/quarks/DIRECTORY folder.

3) You can now install via Quarks.gui.

4) Checkout the MIDetectorOSC guide/overview helpfile.

Wish/Todo-list:
-------------------------

* Solve FIFO errors.
* Correct ON/OFF button.
* Correct Multi-Channel Tagging.
* Integrate the Net part to the Manager.
* Generalize SynthDef creation for N-channels.
* More detectors: FFTbins, FFT Centroids, Specialized Onset Detectors.
* Make awesome documentation and examples with processing.
